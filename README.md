❓ What is ZERO?
--------------

[ZERO](https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/Zero/releases/tag/v2.0.4) is a revolutionary cryptocurrency and transaction platform based on Zcash.

[ZERO](https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/Zero/releases/tag/v2.0.4) offers total payment confidentiality, while still maintaining a decentralised network using a public blockchain.

[ZERO](https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/Zero/releases/tag/v2.0.4) combines Bitcoin’s security with Zcash’s anonymity and privacy.

[ZERO](https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/Zero/releases/tag/v2.0.4) stands out from the competition as a fully working product that has already
implemented a set of special features not found in any other cryptocurrency.

Our main focus as a team and community is to remain as transparent as we can possibly be and to maintain an interactive relationship with everyone involved. We are fully open about the project, listening to all suggestions from investors, miners and supporters.

This software is the [ZERO](https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/Zero/releases/tag/v2.0.4) node. It downloads and stores the entire history of ZERO's transactions, about 1.2GB at this point.
Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process could take several hours.

🔒 Security Warnings
-----------------
See important security warnings on the
[Security Information page](https://z.cash/support/security/).


📒 Deprecation Policy
------------------
Disabledeprecation flag has been removed. Old nodes will automatically be shut down and must be upgraded upon reaching the deprecation block height, which will occur approximately 32 weeks (7/1/2019) from the release of v2.0.4.


🔧 Building
--------
Currently only Linux build is officially supported.  8GB RAM is recommended.

### Install packages (needs to be done only once)
```
sudo apt-get install \
build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib \
autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq \
zlib1g-dev wget curl bsdmainutils automake
```

### Obtain the ZERO software from GitHub
```
git clone https://github.com/zerocurrencycoin/zero.git
cd zero
git checkout master
```

### Download cryptographic keys (needs to be done only once)
```
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
```

### Build the source code to produce binary executables:
```
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
On a typical laptop -j3 works fine, while retaining some UI interactivity
```
./zcutil/build.sh -j3
```

### Create a ZERO configuration file
```
mkdir -p ~/.zero
echo "rpcuser=YOUR_USER" > ~/.zero/zero.conf
echo "rpcpassword=`head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`" >> ~/.zero/zero.conf
echo "rpcport=23800" >> ~/.zero/zero.conf
```

### Seeder Nodes
As of 26/11/2018 the following seeder nodes are up and run a recent Linux version:
```
addnode=34.236.37.74
addnode=178.128.42.10
addnode=86.26.174.151
addnode=46.101.66.152:33801
addnode=zseed1.cryptonode.cloud
addnode=zseed2.cryptonode.cloud
addnode=zeroseed.cryptoforge.cc
```

### Enable CPU mining (optional)
```
echo 'gen=1' >> ~/.zero/zero.conf
echo "genproclimit=1" >> ~/.zero/zero.conf
echo 'equihashsolver=tromp' >> ~/.zero/zero.conf
```

A sample of the current zero.conf
```
./contrib/zero.conf
```
A sample demonstrating a large number of command line options
```
./contrib/debian/examples/zero.conf
```

🔩 Running & Using ZERO
--------------------
After successfully building, the ZERO binaries are stored in `./src`. The two important binaries are `zerod` and `zero-cli`.

Now, run zerod!
```
./src/zerod
```

Your wallet will be created (on first zerod run) in: ~/.zero/wallet.zero
Please backup your wallet often and keep it safe.

The usage is currently the same as ZCash. For more information see the [ZCash User Guide](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide#running-zcash).
